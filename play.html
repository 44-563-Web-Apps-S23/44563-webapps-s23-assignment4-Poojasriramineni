    <h6>THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK ~~~ _Sir James M. Barrie_ </h6>
    <h6>SIR HARRY. [_Complacently._] Did that seem all right, eh?</h6>
    <p>
        If quite convenient (as they say about checks) you are to conceive
        that the scene is laid in your own house, and that_ HARRY SIMS _is
        you. Perhaps the ornamentation of the house is a trifle
        ostentatious, but if you cavil at that we are willing to
        redecorate: you don't get out of being_ HARRY SIMS _on a mere
        matter of plush and dados. It pleases us to make him a city man,
        but (rather than lose you) he can be turned with a scrape of the
        pen into a K.C., fashionable doctor, Secretary of State, or what
        you will. We conceive him of a pleasant rotundity with a thick red
        neck, but we shall waive that point if you know him to be thin
    </p>

    <p>
        It is that day in your career when everything went wrong just when
        everything seemed to be superlatively right.

    <h6 class="name">LADY SIMS.</h6> Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
    sword.</p>

    <p class="harry">
        <h class="name">SIR HARRY.</h> The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
        moments--[_suiting the action to the word_]--the glide--the dip--the
        kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
        beautiful ceremony. [_Kindly._] Anything you can suggest?
    </p>

    <p class="sims">
        <h class="name">LADY SIMS.</h>No--oh, no. [_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
        of a cushion._] You don't think you have practised till you know what to
        do almost too well?
    </p>

    <P>[_He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
        would try any man._</P>

    <p class="harry">
        <h class="name">SIR HARRY.</h> I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
        asked for.

        presents a card._] "The Flora Typewriting Agency."
