        _In_ HARRY'S _case it was a woman who did the mischief. She came to
        him in his great hour and told him she did not admire him. Of
        course he turned her out of the house and was soon himself again,
        but it spoiled the morning for him. This is the subject of the
        play, and quite enough too._

        HARRY _is to receive the honor of knighthood in a few days, and we
        discover him in the sumptuous "snuggery" of his home in Kensington
        (or is it Westminster?), rehearsing the ceremony with his wife.
        They have been at it all the morning, a pleasing occupation._ MRS.
        SIMS _(as we may call her for the last time, as it were, and
        strictly as a good-natured joke) is wearing her presentation gown,
        and personates the august one who is about to dub her_ HARRY
        _knight. She is seated regally. Her jewelled shoulders proclaim
        aloud her husband's generosity. She must be an extraordinarily
        proud and happy woman, yet she has a drawn face and shrinking ways,
        as if there were some one near her of whom she is afraid. She claps
        her hands, as the signal to_ HARRY. _He enters bowing, and with a
        graceful swerve of the leg. He is only partly in costume, the sword
        and the real stockings not having arrived yet. With a gliding
        motion that is only delayed while one leg makes up on the other, he
        reaches his wife, and, going on one knee, raises her hand superbly
        to his lips. She taps him on the shoulder with a paper-knife and
        says huskily: "Rise, Sir Harry." He rises, bows, and glides about
        the room, going on his knees to various articles of furniture, and
        rises from each a knight. It is a radiant domestic scene, and_
        HARRY _is as dignified as if he knew that royalty was rehearsing it
        at the other end_.

        LADY SIMS. [_Much relieved._] I think perfect.
